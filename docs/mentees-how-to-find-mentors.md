# How to find a mentor?

Mentorship is an act, experience, and opportunity that is beneficial to everyone involved. There is no perfect one-size-fits-all approach. It personal to you and the situation!

If you have not read the [Mentee Overview](mentees-overview.md), please do so first!

To find a mentor, it is helpful to reflect on these questions:

- What do I need help with?
- How can mentorship help me?
- What kind/form of mentorship do I want?
