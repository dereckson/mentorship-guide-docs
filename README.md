## 📖 About

Mentorship Guide is a resource focused on making mentorship accessible to all.

## ✨ Mission

To provide mentors and mentees with strategies, resources, and community support.

## 💖 Why

The more mentorship we have, the more inclusive, helpful, collaborative, and innovative our communities become.

## 🚀 What's next?

Short term, we want to keep connecting and bridging existing strategies, resources, and communities.

Medium term, we want to keep expanding our reach, accounting for even more situational and cultural differences.

Long term, there's opportunities to build tooling and infrastructure that would supercharge mentorship efforts.

A wonderful, ongoing journey! 🎉

## 👥 Sponsorship is important

In addition to mentorship, sponsorship is important. There are plans to create a sponsorship guide as well. In the meantime, there is sponsorship related content in our [Resources](docs/resources-overview.md) section. Feel free to submit any helpful resources -- thank you! ✨

## 💻 Local Development

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
yarn install
```

### Development

```
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Additional Resources
